#### Oszor, the dark mage

Illegal son of the king Gerbound, had big chances to become new king before the legal son was born.

Tried to kill the baby, but was caught at trying to do so, so he was banished from the kingdom. In his journey
 for a new house, he stumbled upon a tiny village, and settled down in it. Soon he discovered that it had a secret library underneath it.
 As he dived into the books he found, he slowly studied dark magic.
 
 * Hates the king
 * Became a king himself via revolution, yet he soon discovered how hard it is to be a king
 * Currently is developing a way to rule the world from underground, via ruling other king's minds
 
#### Limpor, the Oszor's student

He was a king in a small kingdom. Everything was great, until Oszor decided to try out his magic on him. The experiment partly failed, because Limpor was soon vanished from his throne.
The Oszor offered Limpor to study magic from him, and one day take over the world with him. Of course he said: "YES!"

 * In secret hates Oszor and want's to kill him, when he finishes his preparations.
 * Not super smart, muddler. He is a son of a great king, yet he didn't inherit his father's properties so well. 

One day Limpor decided, that the day had came, so he found a strong spell in one of Oszor's books, and started casting. Yet, he wasn't a great student, so something went wrong, and the whole house exploded, leaving Oszor and Limpor without a lab and roof.

#### Heinur, the protective demon

After the accident, Oszor stopped to believe Limpor. So he summoned a demon to protect him. Of course the demon wasn't happy about that,
yet he didn't really have a choice. Oszor offered him a whole kingdom, and that was tempting. Oszor created a lamp for him, so he could be summoned at any moment.

He followed Oszor everywhere, as his shadow. Limpor's hate to Oszor grew even stronger, yet he had to keep his feelings in secret.

Without a proper base, Oszor couldn't continue his experiments. So he sent Limpor to find something. Limpor soon reported a castle in not a big distance, yet the owner's were alive.
Oszor decided, that a castle would be a great place to practice, so he with his "band" descended into the castle. He sent Limpor with Heinur forward, to clear the path for himself from castle the inhabitants.

#### The Burning Knight

Heinur hated his lamp. He really wanted to get rid of it. Yet he couldn't do anything about, except if someone wanted to switch places with him.
So he decided to trick Oszor. He offered him power and wisdom, telling him that his own power is inside of this lamp. Without a delay Oszor said yes, but something went wrong once again. Instead of switching place with Heinur, Leinur and Heinur become one being. 

And they he couldn't do anything about it. They had just to accept it. That's how Burning Knight was created.

One part of him wanted to kill Oszor, and second part wanted to protect him.

#### The goblins

In the mountains to the west of the river, lived goblins. They were not very smart, yet they were super practical. They almost never left the mountains, and the more they lived without the sun light, the more they started to hate it. 

Their population wasn't as big, as in the old days. When the humans explored magic lighting, they had to stop the war with the people, and hide in the mountains. They dug out a lot of tunnels in the core of mountains, and learned how to see in the dark. They ate mostly fish and small animals, that lived on the top of the mountains.

Goblins hated everyone, except their own race. They were really envy to people, who now controlled the earth. But they couldn't do much with them, so they had to pour out their anger on everyone, who they saw. They did not learn any new techonogies, since they explored the basic weapons. Most of their techologies came from people, so using anything, created by them was considered shameful. 

Most of the day goblins were digging out tunnels in the dark, expanding their underground kingdom. Who did not dig, fished or hunted, but without any devices, except their own hands. They were excellent swimmers, and rarely fish could hide from them.

Goblin kingdom was rulled by a dynasty, that started even before the goblins met the first people. Their current king, the Blomzeg II, was a cunning ruler. But as any goblin, he hated people, and the goal of his life was to free the surface from them. With his secret council, he developed a plan, that would allow him to erase humans from the face of the earth in a single day. Barely anyone, except him self and the secret council knew anything about those plans, yet in years of his government everyone, who could dig, were thrown into digging one huge tunnel.

#### The gobbo

Blomzeg II wasn't only a cunning leader, he was also a brave goblin. One day, when the tunnel was almost finished, he took his sword, and left the mountain kingdom of goblins. He left his son, Blemtren, to rule goblins after him, and no one really heard anything about him.

One day, Blemtren decided to find his father, and left his son to rule goblins. And yet no one had heard about him too. 

And every goblin ruler after Blomzeg one day decided to go and search for his ancestors, yet no one heard anything about any of them.
