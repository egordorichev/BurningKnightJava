## The kingdom
### Oszor and the new king

Oszor was an illegal son of a king Gerbound, that rulled a small kingdom, that was surreunded by mountains from the north and west, by the great river from the east and the sea from the south. Gerbound made him his heir. The king was wise and smart, and his kingdom flourished and growed. His subjects were mostly peasants and horse breeders. 

One day, a few big ships came from the sea side. The flags on the ships were unknown in these places. The ships looked majestically and menacingly, tho they were in a pretty bad state, it looked like they swam over a huge distance. Gerbound with his son and suite went to meet the unknown strangers. 

The people from the ships sailed from a distant land in the middle of the sea, which drowned and hided below the sea surface a few months ago. They called their selfs sholms, and they've asked for a tiny piece of land to leave on. The king gave him a small area between the sea and the tiny mountain. He and his people really fast became friends with sholms, and very soon they started to feel, like they were one single kingdom.

They hunted together in the big woods to the east of Gerbound's castle, they've built a few cities, learned how to use horses and teached local population how to catch fish.

One day, Gerbound met Emelin, a daughter of sholms ruler. He felt in love, and really soon, they had a wedding. Spouse was really happy, and the kingdom reached one of the peak of happiness and prosperity. And a year or so, a new king was born.

Oszor was very angry, because his entitlement to the throne just moved to the new born king. He decided to kill the baby, so that he could to rule after the death of his father.

### Crime plans and punishment

One dark night, when every one was sleeping, Oszor sneaked into the baby's room. He was already beginning to strangle him, when the maid, who was watching the baby, heard a muffled cry of the baby. She woke up and saw the Oszor. He runned away into the darkness, hoping that she did not recognize him. But the maid told everything to Gerbound, and he decided to send away such a dangerous person as far away, as he can. He decides to send him to the big woods to the east of his castle, and send someone to secretly watch for him.

Oszor had nothing else to do, except follow the command of his father. He found a small outer in the wood, with an ancient castle tower on it. He decides to settle down in it, and start building revenge plans. He was suprised to find a huge secret library under the basement of the tower. It looked like it was a house of a powerful mage before, and he decided to try him self in the dark magic.

## Goblins
### The nation in depths of the mountains

In the mountains to the west of the river, lived goblins. They weren't very smart, yet they were super practical. They almost never left the mountains, and the more they lived without the sun light, the more they started to hate it. 

Their population wasn't as big, as in the old days. When the humans explored magic lighting, they had to stop the war with the people, and hide in the mountains. They dug out a lot of tunnels in the core of mountains, and learned how to see in the dark. They ate mostly fish and small animals, that lived on the top of the mountains.

Goblins hated everyone, except their own race. They were really envy to people, who now controlled the earth. But they couldn't do much with them, so they had to pour out their anger on everyone, who they saw. They did not learn any new techonogies, since they explored the basic weapons. Most of their techologies came from people, so using anything, created by them was considered shameful. 

Most of the day goblins were digging out tunnels in the dark, expanding their undeground kingdom. Who did not dig, fished or hunted, but without any devices, except their own hands. They were excellent swimmers, and rarely fish could hide from them.

Goblin kingdom was rulled by a dynasty, that started even before the goblins met the first people. Their current king, the Blomzeg II, was a fat and 	
cunning ruler. But as any goblin, he hated people, and the goal of his life was to free the surface from them. With his secret council, he developed a plan, that would allow him to erase humans from the face of the earth in a single day. Barely anyone, except him self and the secret council knew anything about those plans, yet in years of his government everyone, who could dig, were thrown into digging one huge tunnel.
