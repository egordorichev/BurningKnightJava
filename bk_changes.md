# The issue

Currently, the game is focused on the gobbo himself, rather on the Knight. The game is called Burning Knight, so it MUST be more focused on
him, than just killing him each level. For the most time gobbo is alone, doing that he wants, mostly acting like in
any other roguelike before. Burning Knight battle is boring, plus it feels unneeded.

# What the game loop is

* Descend onto a level
* Repeat:
  + Go to random room
  + Fight mobs / find treasure / trade
* Stumble upon BK room, fight BK (if dead, restart)
* Grab the key, or finish the level first
* Run to the exit, before he gets you

# How BK used to work before

* In the beginning, BK was the only way you get the light. The game was based more around you 
 manipulating BK to get light, yet keep the distance. You lured him to crops to give them light to grow, 
 and the plan was to use crops as "towers" to kill enemies. **That was boring and weird.**

* BK became your weapon. He attacked you, if you get too close to him or trigger other sensors, followed you
 around, you hand a lamp, that you could use to tp him closer to you. BK projectiles damaged not only you,
 but also the enemies. **Was also pretty boring.**
 
* BK became just an annoying dude following you around and trying to kill you, forcing you to play quick
 and run all the time. **It was fun, stressfull, focused on bk a lot, but players did not like it. Probably 
 the best option from what we tried.**
 
* Before this point, you could stab BK when ever you want. He would go unhurtable and into rage mode, if you get
 his health down to a certant amount, so you OR have to do a lot of fight in the end, OR you fight 
 him the whole game.

* BK became just a boss, that you have to defeat at the end of the level, and then quickly run back, 
 when he respawns, cause you don't want to die. **That's how it is right now, 
 all the issues were already discussed in the first part.**

# Ideas, how to add bk into the mix

* Make the game more meta. You build your own dungeon, by selecting where to go next from a set of rooms,
 some rooms are easier, but they increase BK meter, some are harder. If BK meter fills up, BK will start following you
 till the end of the level. Can grab a lot from FTL.
 
* You have to clear rooms fast, or BK will appear and make your life worse.

* Roll back to "BK always follows you".

* BK follows you around, might or might not attack you all the time. He will keep recreating the dungeon,
 until you kill him. You can stab him at any time. When he dies, portal opens, you go to another area.
 Otherwise, you just keep going through the same level over and over again. 

* BK steals a key from you, when you enter the level, and starts running away from you. He lures you
 into rooms with enemies, and waits in a bit of unreachable spot, while you kill enemies or they
 kill you. He keeps running away, until you clear all the rooms, then he or dissappears leaving the key,
 or you gotta fight him. 

# Requirements

Sadly, because we are closer to the end of the development, than we are to the beginning, we need to find a 
way to change BK, make him a big part of the gameplay, **but with as less time investement, as we can.**
Currently the game has a lot of enemy+dungeon content, so removing it all to make BK feel better is totally not a 
good idea.

# What makes the game more focused on BK

* You think about BK most of the time, rather about dungeon/gobbo
* Or BK is on screen most of the time
* Or you really depend on BK in some way
* Plus a huge plus would be, if we could merge lore into this
