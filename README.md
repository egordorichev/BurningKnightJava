# Burning Knight (Java branch)

**This is not the latest branch of the game, see [this repo](https://github.com/egordorichev/BurningKnight) for the C# branch.**

This is the Java branch of Burning Knight, the second version of the game (first one was written in Lua, but it only lasted for 3 days).
I have to warn you, the code is not pretty. In fact, looking back at it, it's awful. But non the less, I've learned so much from this mess,
and I tried my best to make the C# branch a lot better (and I think it worked out really well).

So. Have fun exploring this jungle. It might be a bit hard to compile, it requires some older gradle version,
and I haven't figured out how to update the gradle build files to the latest syntax.

I hope, that this might be useful to someone. And if so, I'm glad. If you want to get the latest game, [it's available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/851150/Burning_Knight/).
